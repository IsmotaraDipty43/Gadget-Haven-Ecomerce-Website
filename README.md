# React Fundamental Concepts Used
- **Props**: Used to pass data from parent components to child components.
- **State Management (useState)**: Manages and tracks the state of components, such as product details, cart items, etc.
- **Event Handling (onClick)**: Handles user interactions such as clicking buttons to view details or add items to the cart.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Renders components or UI elements based on specific conditions (e.g., showing a loading spinner until data is fetched).
- **useEffect Hook for Side Effects**: Used for data fetching, setting up subscriptions, or manually manipulating the DOM after a component mounts or updates.
- **Keys**: Used to uniquely identify elements in lists to optimize re-rendering and ensure each component is correctly tracked in dynamic lists.

## Data Handling and Management
- **Local Storage**: Used to store cart items and wishlist data persistently even when the user refreshes the page or navigates away.
